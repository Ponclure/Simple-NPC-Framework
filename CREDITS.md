### NPCLib
We forked this project to help assist us with our parent project: Among Us.

### [TinyProtocol](https://github.com/aadnk/ProtocolLib/tree/master/modules/TinyProtocol) by Kristian Stangeland
I used this module of ProtocolLib to intercept packets sent by players whilst interacting with NPCs. After retrieving the data from these packets, I can call a new [NPCInteractEvent](https://github.com/JitseB/NPCLib/blob/master/commons/src/main/java/net/jitse/npclib/events/NPCInteractEvent.java).

### [MineSkin](https://mineskin.org) by Haylee Schäfer
I integrated MineSkin into NPCLib as an easy way for developers to give NPCs a custom skin without buying multiple Minecraft accounts or saving the skin data themselves.

### [bStats](https://bstats.org) by Bastian Oppermann
I use bStats to see how much server are using NPCLib, keeps me motivated and gives me insight in which version are used most. You can see the statistics of NPCLib [here](https://bstats.org/plugin/bukkit/JMB-NPCLib).
