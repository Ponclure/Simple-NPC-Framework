Simple-NPC-Framework â€“ Basic non-player character library.<br>

This is an API made specifically for spigot servers (Minecraft). Current supported versions: **1.8.8 - 1.16.2**. Lightweight replacement for Citizens. Simple-NPC-Framework only uses packets instead of registering the entity in the actual Minecraft server.

This is a forked project from NPCLib, as a lightweight solution to NPC's for cameras in our Camera API.
